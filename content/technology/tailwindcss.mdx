## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a CSS utility framework that is created for utility purposes. It does not involve any built-in UI components and make development easier.

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It reaps very good results by being able to write custom CSS that matches exactly what is needed.

It bothers on code size and extra unnecessary classes and removes any unused styles so that codebase will not be bloated with extra classes.

Using Tailwind, changes you make will be made in your templates which only affects the page youâ€™re working on. This makes it much easier to change a single page without worrying about any side effects.
