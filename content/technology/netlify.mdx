## Netlify

Netlify is a San Franciscoâ€“based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.

The company provides hosting for websites whose source files are stored in the version control system Git and then generated into static web content files served via a Content Delivery Network. Given the limitations of the purely static model, the company later expanded services to include content management systems, and features of serverless computing to handle websites with interactive features.

Netlify is the fastest way to combine your favorite tools and APIs to build the fastest sites, stores, and apps for the web. With first-class support for every modern web framework and a broad ecosystem of API integrations, Netlify helps you build any kind of site or app you can imagine using the best tools for the job. Netlify develops its own open source headless content management system called Netlify CMS.
