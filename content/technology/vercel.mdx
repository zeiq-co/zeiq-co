## Vercel

Vercel (formerly known as ZEIT) is a cloud platform that enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision. Founded in 2015 by Guillermo Rauch, Vercel offers an intuitive user interface with minimal configuration for hosting static site generators such as Gatsby or Hugo and various CMSes like Contentful, Prismic, or WordPress. Vercel is also a parent company of the Next.js framework — and it comes with many cool features.

Vercel allows developers to set up their projects to their custom domain (or a free URL) and a free automatic SSL, protecting shared encrypted data between the server and the browser.

Vercel integrates directly with GitHub or GitLab. It allows developers to host static websites and web applications that deploy upon every push in branches or pull requests to preview changes.

Vercel scales automatically; it requires no orchestration — and operates and monitors with no server configuration.
