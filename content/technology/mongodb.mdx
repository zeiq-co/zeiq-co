## MongoDB

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

MongoDBâ€™s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale. It provide drivers for 10+ languages, and the community has built dozens more.

MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.

MongoDB supports field, range, and regular-expression queries which can return entire documents, specific fields of documents, or random samples of results.

MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets including two or more copies of the data. Writes are handled by the primary replica, while any replica is capable of serving read requests. If the primary replica fails, a secondary replica is promoted to become the primary replica.
