## Apollo

Apollo is a platform for building a supergraph, a unified network of all your data, services, and capabilities that connects to your application clients (such as web and native apps). At the heart of the supergraph is a query language called GraphQL.

The Apollo Supergraph Platform unifies GraphQL across your apps and services, unlocking faster delivery for your engineering teams.

Apollo tracks your GraphQL schemas in a registry to create a central source of truth for everything in your supergraph. Studio allows developers to explore data, collaborate on queries, observe usage, and deliver schema changes with agility and confidence.

Apollo Federation is the industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed supergraph that scales across teams. Use Apolloâ€™s router to compose a supergraph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
