### What is Expo?

[Expo](https://expo.io/) is like the inner part of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework. Expo lets web developers build truly native apps that work across both iOS and Android by writing them once in just JavaScript.

Expo is both a platform and a framework for developing cross-platform, React-based mobile applications. Expo is built around React Native leverages native platforms to provide a set of tools and services for developers.

Since it is a React framework, it operates entirely in Javascript, which allows developers to continue to use their current experience and favored tools with it. Using Expo, developers can quickly create, deploy, and iterate Android, iOS, and web apps from a common code base.

### Advantages of Using Expo

 -  No need to install Android Studio or Xcode to start building.

- You (and other people) can open the project while you're working on it.

-    Expo aims to enhance RN and provide all the JS API you need for the most common needs. It is basically a set of well-defined quality native libs already packaged for you in a      single lib: ExpoKit.
 
 -    Expo has an SDK to handle all kinds of things like using the camera, accelerometer, maps, location tracking, analytics, etc.
