### A resourceful developing tool

It is a way to get data from an API to your application.

GraphicQL highlights the potential issues and makes it easy to build sites that are fast and stable. GraphicQL works by controlling the data instead of the server, this allows a quick response even with a weak network connection.

GraphicQL has three main features :

- Clients can specify the exact type of data needed.

- Data aggregation is very simple.

- A proper system is used to describe data.
