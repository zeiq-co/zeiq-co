You all do well know about the pandemic **COVID-19** that has brought a drastic change in the way we all work and live. All our activities have got affected due to movement limitations and social distancing norms, and workout is also no exception! This has made everyone adopt technologies that can make your ongoing work possible where work can be of any type. This way, even **fitness centres** and **health clubs** have considered coming up with the latest apps and technologies.

So, Today I will say something about our technologies for **Fitness App Development**.

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/), in 2020, global shipments of fitness and activity trackers totalled 396 million devices with a revenue of \$81.5 billion. **Fitness apps** have many advantages as compared to brick-and-mortar gyms. But, at the same time, there may have challenges to address for developing a user-friendly fitness app.

**So Firstly Let's start with Stats about fitness apps.**

- Wearable will remain the largest segment for the fitness sector with an expected market volume of US\$18,984m in 2020.

- The number of fitness app users is expected to reach 378.7 million across the world by the year 2021.

- Revenue in the fitness segment is expected to reach US\$23,127 million by 2024.

**Latest Technology Trends -**

- Wearable Technology

  **Wearable devices** are at their peak in the fitness segment nowadays. From smartwatches to fitness trackers, wearables have started to become a part of our lives. Like [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/) and [Jawbone](https://www.jawbone.com/) are both fitness trackers. Thanks to the launch of the [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/in/watch/) which has increased everyone’s interest in wearables across 2015. As per the Statista, the number of wearable devices will be double from 2019 to 2022.
  This makes to think about integrating fitness apps with wearable devices. That means wearable app development should be evolved to build a standalone tracking app that is compatible with a lot of wearable devices.
  Fitness app developers can use special tools provided by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/in/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/) to make wearable-friendly apps.

- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

  Here the next trend is **AI** and **ML**. Apart from Siri, Alexa, and Cortana (searching tools), the role of AI in the fitness sector is of a virtual trainer for fitness freaks and guide them on maintaining the perfect shape. AI-based features are integrated to offer at-home training in a virtual and personalized way. AI-based fitness assistants will be visible in every app in upcoming years. Machine Learning (ML) technology is necessary for analyzing the user’s data and movement recognition while doing exercises or workouts.

- Virtual and Augmented Reality

  **VR** and **AR** technologies have a lot of potential in the health and fitness sector. Fitness apps provide movements and workout training or practices with the help of virtual reality technology in the apps. Virtual and augmented reality can make the fitness app capable of providing a richer and more personalized experience. One can also integrate gamification using AR and VR technology.
  Augmented reality can also measure performances including elapsed time, power, and heart rate.
  I must say that AR and VR-based featured apps have a good future.

- Streaming Services for fitness app

This point deals with services like **Online fitness training programs** that now easily accessible through fitness apps.
Digital apps are useful because users can watch the training sessions at their convenient time. You don't need to worry about scheduling a meeting with a trainer. What’s more, the monthly subscription for streaming services can be less than a single class at a fitness studio!
Yes, of course, a fitness app with streaming services can work amazingly if you see it.

Every app requires advanced features and a seamless performance based on these technology trends, whether it is a fitness tracking app like [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/), yoga and meditation apps, exercise and workout apps like [Kaa-Yaa](<[https://kaa-yaa.com](https://kaa-yaa.com/)>), or a nutrition monitoring app.
All these latest technologies are very useful for **Fitness App Development**. Improvements of emerging technology are good to integrate, but if you want to make your app ready for the future, you need to concentrate on the performance and user-friendliness of the app. A reputed app development company can help you make the best fitness app with the help of the right tools and technologies.
