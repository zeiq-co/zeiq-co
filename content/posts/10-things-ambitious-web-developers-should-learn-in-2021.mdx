Starting your career in web development is not as easy as it looks, also not as tough as it is. If I say, then I am like Computer-phobic one. But who can think that person like me can go for web development. So, I think anybody can do this If I am doing this.

But the question arises here - what to learn, why to learn, where to start, where to finish etc.

Even if you are a developer and wondering what things you should learn in 2021, this blog might help your understanding further.

In this article, I will share _the essential things a web developer should know_, including the big three of Web development — [HTML](https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-free-html-and-css-courses-to-learn-front-end-web-development-online-8b04517c6ecb), [CSS](http://www.java67.com/2019/01/5-free-bootstrap-course-to-learn-online.html), & [JavaScript](https://hackernoon.com/10-websites-to-learn-javascript-for-beginners-31e13bbdbb5c), and several other useful tools that are required but not mentioned or taught together.

Without taking more of your time, here is my list of tasks a web developer or anyone who aspires to become a web developer should study in 2021.

_Our list may include-_

programming languages like [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

markup language like [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

styling tools like [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/)

IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

tools like Chrome Developer Tools, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

API tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) are a better way to develop APIs.

**10 Things You should go through -**

- **HTML (HTML 5)**

It is the very first step of web development. It's probably the oldest web technology out there and also the first one, but the basic, and you just cannot become a [Web Developer](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) without a good experience of **HTML**. Technically this is a markup language and used to define the structure of your page.

Nowadays, No one generally creates web pages using HTML. Instead, they go for advanced frameworks like Angular and React. But, It doesn't mean that you don't need to learn this step. This language is fundamental, and if you are not clear with your basics, you cannot go further. It makes it easy to understand, debug, and solve problems for which you must know essential HTML tags like div, span, title, headers, etc.

- **CSS (Bootstrap, Flexbox and Grid)**

Apart from HTML, if there exist any other irreplaceable web technology, then it must be **CSS 3** or _Cascading Style Sheet_. CSS styles your web page, I mean to make it look more beautiful. You can also use CSS to specify the layout of the element.

Just like HTML, no one generally writes all the code. Instead, the team use frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), Tailwind CSS, Materialize, etc. CSS is also evolving and explored in Grid, Flexbox etc. In creating any website, the first demand is its beauty or look, which is the headache of CSS.

If you are a beginner, then I think You should start with [Bulma CSS](https://www.zeiq.co/posts/bulma-the-modern-css-framework/) or [Tailwind CSS](https://www.zeiq.co/posts/tailwind-css/).

You can read our [blogs](https://www.zeiq.co/blog) for further information.

- **JavaScript**

So Here, The Third most essential thing any Web developer should learn is **Javascript**. Like, you do when someone clicks buttons, you can change animations and look and feel of your webpage when the user moves the mouse, etc. All those are still right, but [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) now offers much more. You can develop a complete web application end-to-end just using JavaScript.

If HTML is the _backbone_ of the website, Javascript is the _brain_. It has evolved from an essential frontend programming language to a full-stack language, allows you to write backend code.
This language is still evolving. You must go through some javascript courses of 2021 for your better understanding.

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (One JavaScript Library)**

As I said, you need not write HTML and CSS to create your web pages because there are multiple frameworks available to do that job for you. So here, you have a frontend framework like React, which can dynamically generate web pages for you. Also, there is not only this framework. There are many other frontend frameworks that are as powerful as React like [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelete.js](https://svelte.dev/) but I suggest React because it has been adopted by many companies, both small and large and I think it is here for such a long run.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**

Now it's time to take a look at essential tools like **NPM** or **YARN**. If you want to make your work easy and want to put someone's code in your project if needed then it can be done with the help of NPM or YARN. It’s the world’s biggest software registry and hosts more than 800,000 code packages.

Technically, NPM is a package manager of the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager of Node.js, which gives a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This was all talking about tools and technologies for coding. But actually where to apply these technologies and tools is the big question.

Microsoft VSCode has evolved along as the most potent IDE or Editor for Web Development. **Visual Studio Code** is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. You also have plugins for almost anything from developing frontend to connecting to a cloud-like AWS, Azure, and GCP and deploying your application.

If you really want to become a web developer then go for VS Code. Start your Code today with VS Code.

- **Development Tools**

The above skills will get you coding, but what when you meet with bugs or errors. Understanding the development tools offered by browsers can speed up debugging and cut down on frustration. **Chrome** and **Firefox** both offer popular development tools. These tools not only let you see raw HTML but also CSS, JavaScript libraries, and much more. You can even change the CSS classes on the fly and work with the look and feel.

- **Postman**

This is another must-known tool for Web Developers. Since today’s Web world is a Web of **APIs**, you require a tool that can serve you to explore APIs, and for interacting with APIs, there is no better tool than Postman. You can use it to send HTTP requests, access APIs, check their response header, and do much more.

Postman is essential for exploring and understanding whether you connect to internal API or external APIs offered by Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many other payment gateways. You can get postman as a Chrome extension too.

- **Responsive Web Design**

This is also a very important step in becoming a perfect web developer. If you want to develop a website or web application, it must be responsive to provide to your audiences and clients accessing your site from different devices. Responsive web design makes you best present your websites.

- **GraphQL**

If you know, most of the Web is driven by APIs, mainly **REST APIs**. One of the crucial jobs for a web developer is to either develop APIS as a backend developer or consumer those APIs as a frontend developer.

**GraphQL** approaches that problem, and it’s already powering the next level of APIs development.

for deep details, you can go through this - [graphql](https://graphql.org/)

Here, This is all about the 10 most important technologies and tools required for beginners or aspiring candidates.

If you are already familiar with these technologies then must remember that still, they keep evolving. So, Filling some time keeping yourself up-to-date will go a long way in becoming a better web developer.
