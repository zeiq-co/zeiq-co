As a graphic designer, it's important to understand the fundamental design principles that will help you to create effective and visually appealing designs. 
Whether you're working on a logo, a website, or a poster, these principles will guide you in making design decisions that will engage your audience and communicate your message clearly. 
In this article, we'll explore some design principles every graphic designer should know, according to Canva.

### 1.  Balance: 
Balance refers to the distribution of visual elements in a design. A well-balanced design contains elements which are evenly distributed throughout the composition, creating a sense of stability and harmony. There are three types of balance: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial. Symmetrical balance is achieved when elements are mirrored on either side of an imaginary vertical axis. 
Asymmetrical balance is achieved by distributing elements unevenly but still maintaining a sense of balance. Radial balance is achieved when elements are arranged around a central point.
### 2.  Contrast: 
Contrast refers to the difference between elements in a design. Contrast can be created through variations in color, size, shape, texture, or typography. 
Contrast helps to create visual interest and draw the viewer's attention to specific elements in a design.
### 3.  Emphasis: 
Emphasis is used to highlight important elements in a design. This can be achieved through the use of color, size, typography, or placement. Emphasis helps to create a hierarchy and guide the viewer's eye through the design.
### 4.  Repetition: 
Repetition creates a sense of consistency and unity in a design. This can be achieved through the use of patterns, colors, or shapes. Repetition helps to create a cohesive design that is easy for the viewer to understand.
### 5.  Alignment: 
Alignment refers to the positioning of elements in a design. Elements should be aligned with each other to create a sense of order and organization. Alignment helps to create a clean and professional look.
### 6.  Proximity: 
Proximity refers to the placement of elements in relation to each other. Elements that are related should be grouped together to create a sense of unity. Proximity helps to create a clear and organized design.
### 7.  White Space: 
White space, also known as negative space, is the area between elements in a design. White space helps to create a sense of balance and can be used to highlight important elements. White space also makes a design easier to read and understand.
### 8.  Scale: 
Scale refers to the size of elements in a design. Elements can be scaled up or down to create visual interest and hierarchy. Large elements draw the viewer's attention while small elements create a sense of detail.
### 9.  Typography: 
Typography refers to the use of fonts in a design. The choice of font can have a big impact on the overall look and feel of a design. Fonts should be chosen based on the message and audience of the design.
### 10.  Color: 
Color is an important element in any design. Different colors can evoke different emotions and moods. Colors should be chosen based on the message and audience of the design.

With good knowledge of these design principles, you will be able to create visually appealing designs that effectively communicate your message to your audience.

Remember to keep these principles in mind as you work on your next design project!
