Well, there is no need of telling the importance of websites nowadays. Today everyone needs a web existence for their small or big businesses which expands the demand for websites and apps.

There are a lot of factors considered while creating a user-friendly website that will push traffic to your website, appeal to your target markets, and create a unique experience that makes your customers return.

Furthermore, a wrongly done or ugly website will not work to your business's advantage.

So, In my today's blog post, we will talk about the qualities of a great website.

## Well Designed and Functional

It is about the design and layout of the website. It should be easy to read and navigate, uncluttered, and have the same or similar colour scheme throughout. Websites should allow required white spaces, quality photographs etc. Pages should be fast and functional in response.

Poorly constructed and slow websites will leave your visitors frustrated and uninterested in your site.

## Communication

Communication is the key to any great site. It is basically a two-way communication that enables site-to-user and user-to-site contact which can be done by creating special offers to your customers, email newsletters, surveys, contests, providing contact information and many more. That's how It helps in enhancing the website's performance.

## Fresh, Quality Content

It is one of the characteristics considered while talking about an effective website. Your content is the backbone of your site. It helps in SEO ranking and makes your website more communicative with users. Use language that makes sense to your audience, avoid jargon, corporate speak and acronyms. Make your content to the point, accurate, relevant and up-to-date.

Blogs and social media updates are great ways to add fresh content, which keeps the hold on your visitors.

## Mobile Compatibility (Responsive Web Design)

Your website should work on any platform, whether it is pc, tabs or mobiles. Even most people use their smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to browse the internet. It increases the importance to create a website that operates on multiple platforms.

## Clear Call-to-Action

Different websites have different purposes. Every website declares a clear call to action. Even informational sites want visitors to read and share articles, follow the company on social media, download toolkits, join mailing lists or learn more about the organization.

Other sites may include Contact Us, Subscribe, Fill out form or signup/sign in.

## Easy navigation

Websites with easy navigation make it easy for visitors to find what they are looking for when they come to your website. A visitor should easily and fastly navigate from one page to another. It helps to make strong communication between users and sites.

## Optimized for Search and the Social Web

Now, it's not enough to build a site that's looking nice until it earns traffic. All your efforts in design, UX and content development will be useless. So, for ranking SEO you may go through the following points.

-   Use page titles and meta tags on every page and alt tags on every image.
-   Optimize content on your site to align with words real people search for.
-   Use keywords appropriately in content and links.
-   Use Cascading Style Sheets for layout and keep your HTML code clutter-free.
