It's no secret that **SEO** _(Search Engine Optimization)_ is a crucial part of any successful website. Whether you are running an e-commerce store, a blog, or a portfolio website, ensuring that your site had optimized for search engines is the key to increasing traffic and generating leads.

When it comes to SEO, [**Nextjs**](https://nextjs.org/) has a leg up on **plain [React](https://reactjs.org/)**. This is because Nextjs is built from the ground up to optimize for SEO, whereas plain React is not. But why is this the case?

Nextjs is a popular JavaScript framework designed to boost your website’s SEO. It offers several features that make it stand out from Plain React, such as:

- **Pre-Rendering :** Pre-rendering is a process that Nextjs uses to render your website content before it serves the user. This reduces the time it takes for a website to load, which can improve your SEO.

- **Server-side Rendering :** Server-side rendering is a process that renders your website content on the server rather than the client. With SSR, you can render your pages on the server so that search engine crawlers can access them quickly and easily. It can help you get more organic traffic and boost your rankings, which is another factor that affects SEO.

- **Static Site Generation :** Static site generation allows you to build an entire website without having to write any code. It can improve the overall structure of your website, which can help to boost your SEO.

  It allows you to generate static HTML pages for each page on your website, which can help improve loading times and reduce server load.

- **SEO-Friendly :** Nextjs allows you to easily create custom routing, which makes it easier to create SEO-friendly URLs. It can help you to improve your website’s ranking in search engine results.

Unlike Plain React, which requires developers to use a variety of tools and plugins to optimize their website for search engine rankings, Nextjs offers built-in features that make it easier to optimize websites for SEO.

- **Automated SEO :** Nextjs offers automated SEO tools to help you optimize your website for search engine results. It can help you to ensure that your website is optimized for the best possible ranking.

- **Third-Party Integration :** Nextjs also makes it easier to integrate with third-party tools and services, such as Google Analytics and other analytics platforms, which can help you track your website's performance and further improve your SEO.

- **Adding Meta Tags :** Nextjs also helps to improve SEO by providing the ability to add meta tags to your web pages, which can provide additional information to search engines about your content. This can help your content rank higher in search results, resulting in more organic traffic to your website.

In conclusion, Nextjs has a lot to offer when we talk about improving SEO. It’s designed in a way that creates SEO-friendly websites, their tools make it simpler to create fast-loading, optimized pages and its ability to add meta tags to your web pages helps your content to rank higher in search results.
