With the increasing demand of users day by day, Application development has seen enormous growth in the past few years. So, This is a challenge for developers to track new and advanced methods of creating mobile apps that may take the business to a new height.

In this world of digitalization, we have a mobile app for almost everything today and have many ways to offer unique mobile experiences to users. Building mobile apps can be done by applying various methods. We have so many technologies that help us in fulfilling the projects you face.

So, creating a mobile app in 2021, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether to go for native or cross-platform development.

Choosing the Right Platform generally depends on the type of work you are dealing with. Both are having pros and cons.

So, Before going into the comparison, let's understand native and cross-platform.

## **What is Native App Development?**

Native Mobile App Development refers to developing an app for a specific mobile operating system like Android or iOS. These platforms use their languages to run their operating systems. Hence the coding varies for Android and IOS. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [Java](https://www.java.com/) is used for building Android mobile app development. [Swift](https://swift.org/) or [Objective C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#:~:text=Objective-C%20is%20a%20general-purpose%2C%20object-oriented%20programming%20language%20that,Touch%2C%20until%20the%20introduction%20of%20Swift%20in%202014.) works for the iOS mobile app.

### Pros of Native App Development

- They offer excellent performance.

- These apps provide good data security.

- Custom made **UI components** enhances the user experience.

- Preventing bugs is easy.

- The best thing about a native app is that it even works offline, providing good offline performance.

- UI/UX designers find it relatively easy to implement the design standards because of a particular platform.

### Cons of Native App Development

- It is a time-consuming process because it requires more time to develop an app separately for every platform.

- It requires a higher cost as a native app needs to be built separately for different operating systems.

## **What is Cross-Platform Development?**

Cross-platform app development involves building apps that work on different platforms, such as Android and iOS both.

It is the development technique where new frameworks can build native apps without using Swift for iOS or Java for Android. In this case, developers can use a single code base for various platforms. Here the apps are developed through a shared operating environment such as Xamarin. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) are two of the leading cross-platform development frameworks which are used to develop thousands of mobile apps today.

### Pros of Cross-platform Development

- Building apps based on cross-platform apps help to save time and money.

- It uses a single codebase.

- It demands only one team to build apps for multiple platforms or operating systems.

- UI performance matches with Native apps as it shares a similar codebase.

- Organizations can reach out to their target market quickly.

### Cons of Cross-platform Development

- limited functionality

- Cross-platform app development gives the challenge to carry out an optimal user experience.

## **Which Platform to Choose in 2021?**

Both are demanding. Actually, It depends on the Project.

- You should go for native app development if the application demands heavy processing and access to the device features for smooth app functionality. On the other hand, cross-platform would be the best option for creating an app with minimalistic usage and features.

- Native development is an amazing choice for well-settled and sophisticated businesses and those who look forward to investing in the long term. On the other hand, Cross-Platform is best when you are running low on budget and your main motive is providing services to your customers.

- If you want an MVP for your app project soon covering different platforms, consider cross-platform development since it involves a single app development cycle for Android and iOS. Mobile app developers do not have to work on two different versions of the app, making development costs and time lesser. If time and cost aren’t an issue, consider native app development.

Native apps are the primary choice when it comes to high performance and rich user experience. Cross-platform apps, on the other hand, are quick and easy to build but they are not that effective for delivering an equivalent native app-like experience.

From the competing point of view, I think Cross-Platform is better as it works on iOS and Android both.

Now, You can also make your decision based on the above comparison between the native app vs cross-platform for app development in 2021.
