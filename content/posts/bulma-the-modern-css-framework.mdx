Today everyone is familiar with HTML and CSS, the foundation of our web development. When I started working with these languages, I quite enjoyed it. I have started with simple static web pages. But then I came to know that this is a very time-consuming process, especially when we have to deal with fluent technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and many more for web and mobile development.

Then I came to know about CSS frameworks from our developers. Actually, we don't have to write all the CSS by ourselves. We are provided with frameworks that make it very easy for us to code a single web page.

There are multiple CSS framework options out there to choose from like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and Foundation.
There I came to know about [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), the modern CSS framework.
Personally, It was a great experience when I first made a website using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). I don't have to write so much CSS and don't even have to bother so much about its mobile responsiveness.
If you are new to this industry then Bulma CSS will be best for you.

**What is this Framework?**

This is the definition you will get everywhere.

In my words [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is -

- firstly CSS framework

- is built by Jeremy Thomas and is fully open source.

- open-source means its source code is freely available for download and anybody can access it.

- totally based on flexbox

- copy-paste ready-made code if and only if you are clear with your basics.

- provided with an extensive range of built-in features which results in faster turnaround and less CSS code writing.

**Benefits of using Bulma CSS -**

  It can be difficult to try to convert a desktop-designed site for use on a mobile device, but with Bulma, it’s not really an issue. Bulma is a mobile-first CSS framework, offering optimum site responsiveness. Build a site one time and watch it work across any device.
